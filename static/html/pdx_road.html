    <h2>What is Roadside Architecture?</h2>

    <p>Roadside Architecture is a building that becomes the sign for a business it houses. There are three categories:
        Thematic, Iconic, and Whimsical.</p>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <div class="mainBlurbs">
            <div id="thematicBlurb">
                <h3 class="underline"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>hematic</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Thematic Roadside Architecture borrows styles from another time or culture. Thematic styles may be from a
                single
                culture or a blending of many. The goal is to create a unique experience through the architecture that
                marries
                commercial interests with travelogues. Do you know a building that fits this category? Let us
                know! <span class="contactLink underline">Send us a picture or link</span></p>
        </div>

        <div class="mainBlurbs">
            <div id="iconicBlurb">
                <h3 class="underline"><span class="firstLetter">I</span>conic</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Iconic Roadside Architecture results when the public recognizes a building that is so unique it becomes
                the
                image
                of the business. Either by intent or accident, the building becomes a logo, instantly connecting product
                to
                architecture. Do you know a building that fits this category? Let us know! <span

        <div class="mainBlurbs">
            <div id="whimsicalBlurb">
                <h3 class="underline"><span class="firstLetter">W</span>himsical</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Whimsical Roadside Architecture uses a common object to form a building or part of a building. The object
                may
                represent the business, but not always. This is the most delightful of Roadside works. To be Whimsical,
                the
                object does not need to form the entire building, but can simply be incorporated into the design. Do you
                know a
                building that fits this category? Let us know! <span

            <p>Waddle's was designed in 1945 by Portland's most famous architect, Pietro Belluschi. A serious study of
                modern design principles, it became an endearing roadside stop thanks to the name, sign, clock and

            <p>The Broadway Veterinary Clinic by Perkins Architectural was intended by the owner and architect to create

            <p>The Broadway Veterinary Clinic's angular roof brings natural light to key interior spaces. Perhaps
                flamboyant, it is not capricious. If the building becomes an icon it will be not be determined by the

    <p>Whimsical Roadside Architecture uses a common object to form a building or part of a building. The object may
        represent the business, but not always. This is the most delightful of Roadside works. To be Whimsical, the
        object does not need to form the entire building, but can simply be incorporated into the design. Do you know a
        building that fits this category? Let us know! <span

            <p>Looking south on NE 41st towards the Hollywood Theatre. Note the windmill. These buildings served to
                house the original Fred Meyer's Hollywood location before building the modern building with rooftop

            <p>View along Sandy Boulevard of the original Hollywood Fred Meyer. Freddy originally offered automobile
                lube and oil change at this location. Is it possible the windmill was part of a gas station similar to
                the Dutch Village on Terwilliger?</p>

            <img src="../img/whimsical/bomber.jpg">

            <p>The Bomber Gas Station in Milwaukie, Oregon. Art Lacey flew the B-17 from an Air Force Base in 1947. That
                is Art, the proud pilot and owner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="imageAndCaption whimsicalImg">
            <img src="../img/whimsical/bomberWeb.jpg">

            <p>When Art Lacey did his test flight at the Oklahoma Air Base, he needed a co-pilot, but he had traveled
                alone. So, he put a mannequin in the co-pilot's seat and took off. Since the co-pilot is the only person
                who can lower the landing gear, Art crashed the plane and also destroyed another one on the ground in
                the process. The Air Force wrote it off as wind damage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="imageAndCaption whimsicalImg">
            <img src="../img/whimsical/bomberPlane.jpg">

            <p>When Art took off across the country (With a real co-pilot this time) he ran into a snow storm between
                Palm Springs and Klamath Falls. He dropped down under the clouds to follow the rail road tracks so he
                could navigate. While following the railroad tracks in the snow storm, the co-pilot was in the nose cone
                and would shout "Tunnel!" whenever a tunnel was spotted so Art could gain altitude and go over the
                mountain!</p>

            <img src="../img/whimsical/bomberColor.jpg">

            <p>When Art piloted his the Bomber from Oklahoma, he landed his B-17 at the Troutdale Airport, but could not
                obtain a permit to transport the plane to Milwaukie. So, late one Saturday evening, he just drove it
                down
                the highway. All he received was a $10 ticket for an oversize load. Quite the bargain!</p>

            <p>It was not intended to be racist. The smiling winking face was created to attract children and families,
